# Syntax-Analyzer
CS152 Project Phase 2: Parser Generation Using bison

 > Authors: \< [Angela Su](https://github.com/Angela-Su) and [Westin Montano](https://github.com/westinm01)\>

>In the previous phase of the class project, we used the flex tool to create a lexical analyzer for the "MINI-L" programming language that reads in a MINI-L program (from a text file) and identifies the sequence of lexical tokens in the text file. In this phase of the class project, we will create a parser using the bison tool that will check to see whether the identified sequence of tokens adheres to the specified grammar of MINI-L. The output of our parser will be the list of productions used during the parsing process. If any syntax errors are encountered during parsing, our parser should emit appropriate error messages. Additionally, we will be required to submit the grammar for MINI-L that we will need to write before we can use bison.
